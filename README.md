* **Low-friction inputs**: Quick add, voice input, natural language
* **Visual prioritization**: Show just enough tasks to avoid overwhelm
* **Time awareness**: Built-in timers and reminders
* **Gamification**: Reward small wins
* **Executive support**: Suggests break tasks into steps, provides nudges
* **Calming UI**: Soothing colors, minimal clutter

## Key Features

  * **Now** (time-blocked or urgent)
